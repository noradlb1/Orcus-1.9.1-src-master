## Power mode
- The Power-Mode is made for a large amount of clients. The default client list will be replaced by a more suitable in order to guarantee an almost lag free environment. Also, data virtualization will be activated to only download information about visible clients (tested with 10,000 clients)
- Power mode is automatically activated if more than 200 clients are connected to the server (you can disable or always enable it in the settings)

## Android App
I wrote a beautiful Android app which can connect to the server like the administration. For example, if you want to shut down your laughing brother at 9 am on sunday, just shut him down with your smartphone

## Service
The client can install a Windows service which can execute some commands that require administrator privileges, for example trigger a bluescreen, make changes in the registry or change the host file 

# Commands
## Client
**Control**
- Uninstall
- Kill
- Make admin
- Patch
